=============

This Android application prints PDF files to UNIX printers in the NUS School of Computing via the usage of SSH commands. Custom server address and printers can be added.

Warning: This app works even outside the vicinity of the NUS network. So don't be too trigger happy with the print button.

Kingsoft supports saving of doc and docx files as pdf. Use Kingsoft to convert files for printing.

Main Features:

1. Print PDF files
2. Remaining quota check
3. Print Status Check
4. Print to custom printer
5. Page formatting for pdf files
6. Can share files to this app via file browser applications


Things to take note:

1. Check the printer status first before printing

2. Don't hit multiple actions more than once, every single click corresponds to a new request.

3. Avoid using 3G or unstable connection when printing, the SSH library may go haywire over this. A Wifi network or better yet, the NUS's Wifi network is always preferred.

4. If the force disconnect button does not work, force a closure of the app by removing it from the recent task list. Then open it again.

5. Since this app is still new, bugs are to be expected. Inform me if you do encounter them.


Bugs so far: 

1. Page border for M2 does not work

2. Pages/Sheet dropdown menu does not appear properly on Android 4.3 devices
